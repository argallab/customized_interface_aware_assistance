Phase -1 (Preparation):

#Generate trials for the subject and the trial order.
a) create experiment blocks for subject:
python create_experiment_blocks --subject_id name_of_subject

b) Generate randomized ordering of blocks
python experiment_block_order_generator (note down the order of blocks on a piece of paper)

c) Open 6 different incognito tabs on the tablet for all post-task qualtrics survey so that it is ready to go

d) Open a separate incognito window for qualtrics familiarization phase
https://northwesterneng.az1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_5biu1XSbex3VKVn

e) Open a separate incognito window for POST SESSION SURVEY

Introductory spiel:

The study will last approximately 2 hours and will consist of different phases.
The first phase will be a familiarization phase in which you will get to know what the study is about,
what the tasks are and how you will be performing these tasks.
Following the familiarization phase, we will proceed to a training phase, during which
you will be trained on more detailed aspects and the essential skills that are required to
perform the tasks. You will be tested on how well you have acquired these skills. The training will be repeated
until you reach a minimum level of proficiency.
Following the training phase that we will proceed to the main study.

PHASE 0 (Opening):

a) Show subject tab from d) in Phase -1. Have subjects complete the Qualtrics familiarization phase

PHASE 1 (Training):

Internal Model Mapping Training

a) roslaunch simulators p_ui_given_a_sim.launch subject_id:=NAME-OF-SUBJECT save:=true iteration:=1 block:=6

Check if they have reached proficiency by running
cd src/data_processing/scripts ./generate_personalized_p_ui_given_a.sh NAME-OF-SUBJECT

If more training is needed there will be a printout at the end which says NEEDS MORE TRAINING.
If so, repeat a) in PHASE 1.

Interface Physical Action Training

a) Free exploration (with feedback)
roslaunch simulators sip_puff_training_simulator.launch iteration:=5

b) Prompted training (with feedback)
roslaunch simulators sip_puff_training_simulator.launch iteration:=5
In rqt_reconfigure select prompted
press 's' to start prompted training.

c) Prompted Testing (no feedback)

roslaunch simulators p_um_given_ui_sim.launch SNP:=true duration:=4 iteration:=15 subject_id:=NAME-OF-SUBJECT save:=true

Putting it all together

Get familiar with the environment.
roslaunch simulators p_um_given_a_sim.launch subject_id:=NAME-OF-SUBJECT SNP:=true save:=false training:=1

Test
roslaunch simulators p_um_given_a_sim.launch subject_id:=NAME-OF-SUBJECT SNP:=true save:=true training:=0

Generate distributions from data collected
cd src/data_processing/scripts ./generate_personalized_distributions_from_bags.sh NAME-OF-SUBJECT

PHASE 2 (Testing):

(Repeat b-1 and b-2 until all blocks are completed)

a) Quick training to explain the path and what information is shown on screen.
roslaunch simulators modeinference_sim.launch SNP:=true JOINT:=true subject_id:=NAME-OF-SUBJECT assistance_block:="no" block_id:=0 training:=1 save:=false optim:=0

b-1) run experiment:
roslaunch simulators modeinference_sim.launch SNP:=true JOINT:=true subject_id:=NAME-OF-SUBJECT assistance_block:=ASSISTANCE_CONDITION block_id:=BLOCK_ID training:=0 save:=true optim:=0

b-2) After each block Post Task Survey:

End of All Blocks:
Have the subject fill out the Post Session Ranking Survey:
